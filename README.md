# Deep-Learning Medical Image Reconstruction


## Overview
This project explores the use of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and their variants to address **inverse problems in medical imaging**, specifically focusing on **image reconstruction**. While CNNs have shown remarkable success in classification and segmentation tasks, their application to inverse problems such as **denoising, deconvolution, and super-resolution** has been more debated. Recent literature suggests that CNNs may not always outperform traditional methods like **compressed sensing**.

Our work investigates these claims by experimenting with **modified CNN architectures** designed to improve reconstruction accuracy. The goal is to evaluate whether deeper or more specialized CNN designs can **outperform sparsity-based approaches** and achieve **higher fidelity reconstructions** in medical imaging.

## Key Objectives
- Implement CNN architectures for medical image reconstruction.  
- Compare results against traditional **compressed sensing** methods.  
- Evaluate performance on tasks like **denoising, deconvolution, and super-resolution**.  
- Propose an **improved CNN architecture** that shows higher reconstruction accuracy.  

## Methodology
1. **Dataset**: Large-scale medical imaging datasets (MRI/CT).  
2. **Models**: Baseline CNNs and derived architectures.  
3. **Tasks**: Denoising, deconvolution, super-resolution, reconstruction.  
4. **Metrics**: Accuracy, reconstruction error (PSNR, SSIM), and comparison with compressed sensing.  

## Results
- Demonstrated that CNN variants can achieve **improved accuracy** in medical image reconstruction.
